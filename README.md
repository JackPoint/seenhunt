# SeenHunt

It's a browser extension for both Chrome and Safari to help you keep track of which items on Product Hunt are new since your last visit. If it's new, it gets an aubergine emoji.

## Installing in Safari

Just [download from here](https://github.com/drcongo/seenhunt/blob/master/build/seenhunt.safariextz?raw=true) and double click the downloaded file.

## Installing in Chrome

Download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seenhunt/lnkdimlaioljolinphlgmngcodjkehpk).

_Note: Linux users should install "ancient" font, for emoji support._

Feel free to fork and add features and submit pull requests if you think they'd be useful to others.

## Limitations

- Keeps track in HTML5 localStorage, so if you switch computers your state will be lost
- Only applies aubergines to products in the initial page load
- Auto cleans localStorage to remove items that you saw more than about 3 days ago. This helps keep localStorage manageable.

## Aubergine

It's an eggplant.
